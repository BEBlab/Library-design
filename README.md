# Library-design

Folder with all scripts used to design oligopools. 

- DesignALibraryofSingles_IDT_NNK.R Use this script to design an oligopool of single mutants of a certain sequence. It introduces an NNK in codon each position and a synonymous subsitution at another codon in the sequence. This should minimise the number of 1 nt sequences seen in the Dimsum report. Each oligo will have a different synonymous substitution.
